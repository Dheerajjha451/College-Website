# College-Website

This is the Beginner HTML, CSS, and Javascript Project. For setting up this repo code in your
local host, you need a code editor. I used VS Code as a code editor. 
You need to install Live Server in your VS code for locally hosting the college website.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dheerajjha451/College-Website
cd your-repository
